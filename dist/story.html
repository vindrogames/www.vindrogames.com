            <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> 2016: First Game Jam</h3>
            <p>We had been playing around with lot's of different ideas, but nothing ever came of them. Zeneke found out about a Game Jam and we went for it! And thus was born "A Greek Tale". Not much, but a mile-stone for us! We actually created our first game, from scrath.</p>

            <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> 2018: RPG Maker</h3>
            <p>Mikelele knows some fellow teachers around Spain that use this software to create RPG Zelda type games for computers. We had to try it out and created our game about the human brain. Still don't have a name for it! There will be more RPG games to come...</p>

            <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> 2019: GoDot</h3>
            <p>Zeneke started playing around with GoDot and we used the boardgame "SET" to use it for some good. We tried this game with other languages but finally got the job done with GoDot. This is probably our most complete accomplishment so far!</p>

            <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> 2020: Google Apps Script</h3>
            <p>Mikelele wanted to take his use of Google Workspace tools to the next level and so started playing around with Spredsheets and then Google Apps Script. More than just automating certain processes, we can actually make games, or game-like activities, to do with students!.</p>

            <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> 2020: Cloud Security</h3>
            <p>Zeneke dives into the world of Cloud, specializing in Cloud Security at Siemens, automating deployments with scripts and dev-ops providing a stage for growing as a developer with Python and Dot.Net.</p>

            <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> 2021: 42 Madrid</h3>
            <p>Mikelele participated in the 42 Madrid Programming school "piscine" and was accepted into the 42 school where he learned a lot about programming in general, working with C and unix. We haven't done any projects per say with C but it has deeply strengthened our learnings.</p>

            <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> 2022: Vindrogames 2.0</h3>
            <p>Mikelele begins Full-Stack courses centered around HTML, raw CSS with SASS and Javascript to revamp this very website you are visiting. This website is built with SASS, JQUERY and deployed with Netlify from our Github, but you wouldn'y know you've been Netlified!</p>

            <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> 2023: Logic & Games</h3>
            <p>Zeneke and Mikelele really start exploring different algorithms by "digitalizing" different boardgames, mainly different cards games to play in solitaire version. If you like board games don't miss out on SET! on our <a href="games.html">games page</a>. And stay tuned, there are many more to come!</p>

            <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> 2024: Backend</h3>
            <p>Things are really coming along and as Mikelele is becoming more confident, Zeneke pushes vindrogames to work with the backend. We started out with a fun Madrid Calculator with some simple endpoints and are slowly working towards player profiles for our games and Apps.</p>
